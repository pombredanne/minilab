Summary of project:
    This code is an implementation of a classifier for License Plate
    Recognition, using Local Binary Patterns as features for a Support Vector
    Machine.
    
    A number of scripts are provided to execute tests with this code, and to
    see how well the code performs, both when considering accuracy and speed.
    There is also a script that automises the search for proper parameters for
    the SVM.
    
    In the docs folder, a report can be found with a more extensive description
    of the theory, the implementation and the results.
    
    The images folder contains a sorted dataset of characters, cut out from
    real life images of license plates, provided by Parkingware Schiphol.
